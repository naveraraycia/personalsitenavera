  <!--DRAWING SKILL -->
    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="draw-img" src="images/digital.png" alt="draw-img">
      <h3 id="skill1">Drawing</h3>
      <p>Drawing is a therapeutic activity that allows a person to present his or her creativity through Art. I always loved art ever since I was young but I'm sure I was not really good at
      it. Last year when the pandemic started and there was little to nothing to do at home, it is when I started having interest in digital art. It is when I started creating lots of pieces that were first done out of fun
    but is now done with passion and excellence (wow). </p>

  <!--CLEANING SKILL -->
    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="clean-img" src="images/clean.png" alt="clean-img">
      <h3>Cleaning</h3>
      <p>Cleaning is a very essential skill in life. Even if everybody can do it, I believe that not everyone is good at it which is why I consider
      cleaning as a skill. When I am stressed or need to do something that will make me feel relaxed and productive, I always opt to cleaning and organizing my stuff. The feeling of fulfillment afterwards seems very rewarding.</p>
    </div>

  <!--MEMORIZATION SKILL -->
    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="memorize-img" src="images/memorize.png" alt="memorize-img">
      <h3>Memorization</h3>
      <p>Memorization is another very convenient skill in life specially for education-purposes. This is a skill that I have honed throughout my years in Engineering school. It has helped
       me a lot in surviving my course. I believe that one does not need to be smart or a genius in Math to pass Engineering, one just needs to be patient in studying and good at memorizing. </p>
